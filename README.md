### Simple enough, this is a "hangman" style game bassed off of Beatles Song Titles
    
    * Once the page is rendered, a random song title will be generated
    * Start by pressing any key
    * If succesful you add points to you game, vice versa you'll tally up losses
    * Can only be played w/ a keyboard

### Have fun
