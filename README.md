# Word Guessing Game

https://morralex.github.io/word-guess-game/

### Simple enough, this is a "hangman" style game bassed off of Beatles Song Titles
    
    * Once the page is rendered, a random song title will be generated
    * Start by pressing any key
    * If successful you add points to your score, vice versa you'll tally up losses
    * Can only be played w/ a keyboard

### Have fun!!
